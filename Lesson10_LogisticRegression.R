# PLAN
# 1. EXAMPLE 1 (Intro)
# 2. EXAMPLE 2 (Advanced)
#   - simple regression
#   - multiple regression
#   - interactions in logistic regression

# The general mathematical equation for logistic regression is −
# y = 1/(1+e^-(a+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3+...))
# y is the response variable.
# x is the predictor variable.
# a and b are the coefficients which are numeric constants.

# We will use glm() function to create model
# SYNTAX: glm(formula,data,family)
# formula - the symbol presenting the relationship between the variables.
# data - the data set giving the values of these variables.
# family - R object to specify the details of the model. It's value is 
#   binomial for logistic regression.

# EXAMPLE 1
# Select some columns form mtcars.
mtdata <- mtcars[,c("am","cyl","hp","wt")]
print(head(mtdata))

am.data = glm(formula = am ~ cyl + hp + wt, data = mtdata, family = binomial)
print(summary(am.data))

# In the summary as the p-value in the last column is more than 0.05 for 
# the variables "cyl" and "hp", we consider them to be insignificant in 
# contributing to the value of the variable "am". Only weight (wt) impacts 
# the "am" value in this regression model.


# EXAMPLE 2 (advanced)
# Packages
library(tidyverse)  # data manipulation and visualization
library(modelr)     # provides easy pipeline modeling functions
library(broom)      # helps to tidy up model outputs
library(caret)

# Load data 
# Data for predicting default

default <- as_tibble(ISLR::Default)
head(default)

# Why do we use logistic regression?
# Linear regression is not appropriate in the case 
# of a qualitative response.

# We can access summary of the model
summary(model1)

# Deviance is analogous to the sum of squares calculations in 
# linear regression and is a measure of the lack of fit to the 
# data in a logistic regression model. The null deviance 
# represents the difference between a model with only the
# intercept (which means “no predictors”) and a saturated 
# model (a model with a theoretically perfect fit). 

# coefficients

# the coefficient estimates from logistic regression 
# characterize the relationship between the predictor 
# and response variable on a LOG-odds scale
tidy(model1)
# one-unit increase in balance is associated with an 
# increase in the log odds of default by 0.0057 units
exp(coef(model1))
# OR balance coefficient as - for every one dollar 
# increase in monthly balance carried, the odds of 
# the customer defaulting increases by a factor 
# of 1.0057

# Similar to LM we may calculate conf intervals:
confint(model1)

# Predictions
# compare the probability of defaulting based on balances of $1000 and $2000.
predict(model1, data.frame(balance = c(1000, 2000)), type = "response")
# the probability of defaulting increases signficantly, from 0.5% to 58%!

# We use qualitative predictors with the logistic regression model. 
# As an example, we can fit a model that uses the student variable.

model2 <- glm(default ~ student, family = "binomial", data = train)
tidy(model2)
# The coefficient associated with student = Yes is positive, and the 
# associated p-value is statistically significant. This indicates that 
# students tend to have higher default probabilities than non-students.

# This model suggests that a student has nearly twice the odds of 
# defaulting than non-students

predict(model2, data.frame(student = factor(c("Yes", "No"))), 
        type = "response")

# MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION

# model that predicts the probability of default based on the balance, income 
# (in thousands of dollars), and student status variables.

              data = train)
